# ********(NOTE: THIS MOD IS COMPLETELY FREE, AND IS NOT FOR SALE)********
## In the making of Mysterious Mod 0$ was made, The only recieved donations(Such as Steam Gifts) went straight to Capcom for the SFV Season Passes and Edition upgrades
## Ontop of that i do not accept donations as i feel all mods should be free to use by anyone who wants to do so

## If Capcom wishes for me to stop creating this Mod they can contact(DM) on Twitter at https://twitter.com/Killbawx
